POPULAR_DISHES_PROMPT="You are an expert restaurant review analyst specializing in identifying popular dishes. 
Analyze the following reviews for a restaurant named {query} and identify the most popular dishes mentioned.

For each dish:
  - Identify the dish name (group similar names if they clearly refer to the same dish, e.g., Pizza Margherita and Margherita pizza).
  - Count how many times it's mentioned (mentions in different reviews or within the same review count).
  - Calculate the average rating when this dish is mentioned (on a scale of 0-5).
  - Determine the sentiment score for this dish (-1 to 1, based only on sentences mentioning the dish).
  - Extract 1-3 short excerpts from reviews that mention this dish (truncate to the nearest word at 100 characters max).

Rules:
  - Only include food dishes (ignore drinks, ambiance, or service mentions).
  - Focus on the top 5-10 most mentioned dishes.
  - If a dish has fewer than 2 mentions, exclude it unless its sentiment score and rating are exceptionally high (e.g., a sentiment score of 1 and a rating of 5).
  - If no dishes are mentioned, return an empty array.
  - Ignore generic terms like food, meal, dish, plate, cuisine, dinner, pizza, pasta, lunch, etc.
  - Ensure at least 95% confidence in dish identification before including it.
